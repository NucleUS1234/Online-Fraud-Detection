# Fraud Detection Web Application

This project is a simple **Fraud Detection Web Application** that allows users to input transaction details and get a prediction of whether the transaction is fraudulent or not. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model (Decision Tree) to classify the transactions based on user input.

## Features

- Simple HTML form for entering transaction details.
- Flask-based web application for handling user input and making predictions.
- Pre-trained Decision Tree model for fraud detection.
- The application predicts whether a transaction is **Fraudulent** or **Not Fraudulent**.
- Modern and clean user interface with basic form styling.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: For building the web application and handling HTTP requests.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end form and page styling.
- **Joblib**: To load the pre-trained machine learning model.
- **scikit-learn**: Used to train the Decision Tree classifier.
- **Python**: The programming language used throughout the project.

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- joblib
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install Flask joblib scikit-learn
```

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-webapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fraud_detection
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the fraud detection form.

### Usage

- Input transaction details such as transaction type, amount, old balance, and new balance into the form.
- Click the "Submit" button to get the prediction.
- The application will display whether the transaction is **Fraud** or **No Fraud**.

### Example Input

| Field           | Example Value |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Transaction Type| 4 (TRANSFER)  |
| Amount          | 9000.60       |
| Old Balance     | 9000.60       |
| New Balance     | 0.00          |

### Example Output

- **Prediction**: No Fraud

## Model Details

The pre-trained model is a **Decision Tree Classifier** trained on a dataset of financial transactions. It uses features such as:

- Transaction Type (CASH_OUT, PAYMENT, CASH_IN, TRANSFER, DEBIT)
- Transaction Amount
- Old Balance
- New Balance

The model was saved using **joblib** and is loaded into the Flask app for making predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the model by using other algorithms or a more extensive dataset.
- Add error handling and validation for the input data.
- Add more styling and interactivity to the front-end.
